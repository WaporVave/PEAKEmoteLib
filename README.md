# PEAKEmoteLib

PEAKEmoteLib is a library offering an API for adding custom emotes to the game [PEAK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/).

Extra emotes are added to additional pages on the wheel, which can be accessed with the vanilla "next" and "previous" buttons, or by scrolling with the mouse wheel.
